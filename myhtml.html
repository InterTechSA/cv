    <div id="Summary">
        <p>I am a young energetic, hardworking and responsible individual doing Computer Sciences in the University of
            KwaZulu-Natal. I chose this career as I believe it is fundamental in bringing great change in the country
            and the world as whole. I aim to offer my acquired skills in the introduction of the Forth Industrial
            Revolution which is already amongst. I also hope to improve the lives of those in rural areas by creating
            apps and information systems which will change their way of living and allow them to have more access to
            life changing opportunities. I fell in love with this career when I first learnt of Bill Gates in the 9th
            grade. I became obsessed with how he changed his life through Computer programming and became one the most
            influential individuals in the world. My dream is to own a Software company which will become a friendly
            rival of Google.</p>
